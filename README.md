# Smart-Lighting-System-Manger
 An end‑to‑end, fully automated home lighting system with feedback‑based control over interior and exterior LEDs.   Uses light (LDR) and motion (ultrasonic) sensing to drive auto‑on/off and brightness, plus a VB.NET GUI for manual override, power estimation, and statistical analysis.
